        <p class="mb-5 whitespace-pre-wrap"><strong>I need specific shots, can you shoot them for me?</strong></p>
        <p class="whitespace-pre-wrap ml-10 mb-5">In addition to our stock library, we are also a full service production company. Our union and non-union crews can integrate with your main unit and shoot on your set with your picture vehicles, stunt drivers, and actors or we can travel to bring specific shots back from anywhere in the world. A huge benefit to our rig is its portability. It was designed from the ground up to travel, fitting in a single suitcase and a carry on bag and mounting to any vehicle, including rental cars.Please <a href="/contact" class="text-[rgba(128,212,255,.6)]">contact us</a> for pricing and availability.</p>
        <p class="mb-5 whitespace-pre-wrap">What am I buying?  What comes in a set?</p>
        <p class="mb-5 whitespace-pre-wrap ml-10">A set consists of 9 angles: 8 overlapping angles every 45 degrees around the car and a forward facing, up-angled reflection.</p>
        <p class="mb-5 whitespace-pre-wrap">What makes your footage better than others?</p>
        <p class="whitespace-pre-wrap ml-10 mb-5">Driving Plates shoots with a patented (US Patent No. 88141812), height adjustable, multi-camera array that is designed for the sole purpose of shooting driving footage using a configuration that is optimized for the best possible orientation for compositing.  All nine angles are captured simultaneously so the action in every angle matches.  The field of view provides an optimal 30% overlap for easier stitching along with arranging the cameras with the front and rear angled spaces in a near nodal arrangement minimizing stitching errors.   Our library has been used in over 1000 productions and we stand behind every clip we sell.  Our customer service is legendary.</p>
        <p class="mb-5 whitespace-pre-wrap">I only want one angle, do I have to buy the whole set?</p>
        <p class="whitespace-pre-wrap ml-10 mb-5">In order to achieve the most realistic results possible, we encourage our customers to utilize all 9 angles as much as possible. This will help build depth to the composition using the extra angles as reflections to enhance the movement of the vehicle.   Individual files require us to prepare a separate file for you and may take up to 24 hours to deliver.  Please <a href="/contact" class="text-[rgba(128,212,255,.6)]">contact us</a> for pricing and availability.</p>
        <p class="mb-5 whitespace-pre-wrap">Can I get full resolution files to test before I commit to buying?</p>
        <p class="whitespace-pre-wrap ml-10 mb-5">We will provide watermarked proxy files upon request.  Please <a href="/contact" class="text-[rgba(128,212,255,.6)]">contact us</a> with the ID Number for the footage you would like.  Although we will do our best to deliver them to you same day, please allow 24 hours for delivery.</p>
        <p class="mb-5 whitespace-pre-wrap">Can I use your footage for LED projection?</p>
        <p class="whitespace-pre-wrap ml-10 mb-5">We are the industry leader in advancing the technology behind the LED process and have contributed to hundreds of LED projection shoots with great success across multiple platforms.  The needs of LED vary slightly from green screen compositing so we have indicated the suitability of each clip on the clipâ€™s preview page.  Additionally, LED requires some post processing for best results, please <a href="/contact" class="text-[rgba(128,212,255,.6)]">contact us</a> for more details.</p>
        <p class="mb-5 whitespace-pre-wrap">What is the resolution, frame rate, and codec of the clips?</p>
        <p class="whitespace-pre-wrap ml-10 mb-5">Our library started before 4k existed, so these legacy clips are only available in HD.  The vast majority of the library is available in 4k and HD to suit your needs and budget.   We are currently shooting additional European locations for the library at 25 fps in order to accommodate the use of different frame rates outside of the US. The codecs have also evolved over time.  Our older footage is available in AVCHD while or newer 4K footage is available in h.264. </p>
        <p class="mb-5 whitespace-pre-wrap">Do you have 4k plates?</p>
        <p class="whitespace-pre-wrap ml-10 mb-5">Yes! We have multiple 4k rigs that frequently shoot driving footage for the library and they are also available for custom projects. New clips are being uploaded weekly. We have also added 10 bit 4:2:2 to our menu of options in order to service clients wishing to have greater color depth plates. Please <a href="/contact" class="text-[rgba(128,212,255,.6)]">contact us</a> if you are looking for something specific and we can help you out!</p>
        <p class="mb-5 whitespace-pre-wrap">Can I get footage over the weekend?</p>
        <p class="whitespace-pre-wrap ml-10 mb-5">Due to our boutique nature, we keep a 9-5 schedule, Monday through Friday (PST), and are not a 24/7 company.  We offer a concierge service and appreciate your understanding and patience if a rush order needs the requested 48 hours to be fulfilled.  As we do not operate on weekends, a rush fee will apply if a weekend request is needed.  </p>
        <p class="mb-5 whitespace-pre-wrap">What side of the road do you drive on?</p>
        <p class="whitespace-pre-wrap ml-10">We are greatly expanding our international collection and are acquiring right and left driving footage in accordance with the laws of each location.  Here's a handy list of left and right drive countries... <a class="text-[rgba(128,212,255,.6)]" href="http://www.worldstandards.eu/cars/list-of-left-driving-countries/" target="_blank">http://www.worldstandards.eu/cars/list-of-left-driving-countries/</a></p>
